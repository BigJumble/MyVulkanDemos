- [ ] better project structure
- [ ] Input manager - use sets to record input
- [ ] player controller freecam
- [ ] sphere sim - render n spheres - dual buffering
- [ ] physics for spheres - uniform grid or aabb from RT khr
- [ ] constraints 1 - connect spheres together via springs
- [ ] constraints 2 - deformation physics
- [ ] constraints 3 - break after too much deformation
- [ ] constraints 4 - contract/relax rope based from input from cpu
- [ ] figure out how entities should be constructed
- [ ] ECS - each physics object should be represented as component
- [ ] physics sensors - pass data from simulation to cpu
- [ ] models - many connected physics objects/sensors = entitiy
- [ ] AI for entity, procedural animation
